# Templates

Templates are git repositories whose files contain placeholders. The current
supported placeholders are:

* `{{authors}}`

  this will be filled in by a function borrowed from Cargo's source code, that determines your information from Cargo's configuration. It will either be on the form `username <email>` or just plain `username`.
* `{{project-name}}`

  this is supplied by either passing the `--name` flag to the command or working with the interactive CLI to supply a name.
* `{{crate_name}}`

  the snake_case_version of `project-name`
* `{{crate_type}}`

  this is supplied by either passing the `--bin` or `--lib` flag to the command line, contains either `bin` or `lib`, `--bin` is the default
* `{{os-arch}}`

  contains the current operating system and architecture ex: `linux-x86_64`
* `{{username}}`

  this will be filled in by a function borrowed from Cargo's source code, that determines your information from Cargo's configuration.

Additionally, **all filters and tags** of the liquid template language are supported.
For more information, check out the [Liquid Documentation on `Tags` and `Filters`][liquid].

[liquid]: https://shopify.github.io/liquid

You can use those placeholders in the file and directory names of the generated project.
For example, for a project named `awesome`, the filename `{{project_name}}/{{project_name}}.rs` will be transformed to `awesome/awesome.rs` during generation.
Only files that are **not** listed in the exclude settings will be templated.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: invalid characters for a filename or directory name will be sanitized after template substitution. Invalid is e.g. `/` or `\`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Deprecated** in favor of using [ignore in `cargo-generate.toml`](#Ignoring-files)
>
> You can also add a `.genignore` file to your template. The files listed in the `.genignore` file
> will be removed from the local machine when `cargo-generate` is run on the end user's machine.
> The `.genignore` file is always ignored, so there is no need to list it in the `.genignore` file.

## Templates by the community

It's encouraged to classify your template repository [with a GitHub topic](https://docs.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/managing-repository-settings/classifying-your-repository-with-topics) labeled `cargo-generate`.

So that every developer can find the template via [cargo-generate topic on GitHub](https://github.com/topics/cargo-generate).

If you have a great template, please tag your repository with the topic [and tweet about it](https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=See%20my%20new%20%23cargogenerate%20%23template%20%0A%0A%3E%20your%20link%20goes%20here) by including the hashtag [`#cargogenerate`](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cargogenerate&src=typed_query) (since twitter does not support hashtags with `-`).

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: the list of [currently available templates](TEMPLATES.md) is still available, but is now deprecated.

### Example for `--bin` and `--lib`

A template could be prepared in a way to act as a binary or a library. For example the `Cargo.toml` might look like:

```toml
[package]
# the usual stuff

[dependencies]
{% if crate_type == "bin" %}
structopt = "0.3.21"
{% endif %}
# other general dependencies

{% if crate_type == "bin" %}
[[bin]]
path = "src/main.rs"
name = "{{crate_name}}-cli"
{% endif %}
```

Now a user of this template could decide weather they want the binary version by passing `--bin`
or use only the library version by passing `--lib` as a command line argument.

## Template defined placeholders

Sometimes templates need to make decisions. For example one might want to conditionally include some code or not.
Another use case might be that the user of a template should be able to choose out of provided options in an interactive way.
Also, it might be helpful to offer a reasonable default value that the user just simply can use.

Since version [0.6.0](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/releases/tag/v0.6.0) it is possible to use placeholders in a `cargo-generate.toml` that is in the root folder of a template.
Here [an example](https://github.com/sassman/hermit-template-rs):

```toml
[placeholders.hypervisor]
type = "string"
prompt = "What hypervisor to use?"
choices = ["uhyve", "qemu"]
default = "qemu"

[placeholders.network_enabled]
type = "bool"
prompt = "Want to enable network?"
default = true
```

As you can see the `placeholders` configuration section accepts a table of keywords that will become the placeholder name.

In this example the placeholder `hypervisor` and `network_enabled` will become template variables and can be used like this:

```rs
{% if network_enabled %}
use std::net::TcpListener;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").unwrap();
    loop {
        let (conn, addr) = listener.accept().unwrap();
        println!("Incoming Connection from {}", addr);
        std::io::copy(&mut &conn, &mut &conn).unwrap();
    }
}
{% else %}
fn main() {
    println!("Hello Rusty Hermit ü¶Ä");
}
{% endif %}
```

> üí° Tip: similar to `dependencies` in the `Cargo.toml` file you can also list them as one liners:

```toml
[placeholders]
hypervisor = { type = "string", prompt = "What hypervisor to use?", choices = ["uhyve", "qemu"], default = "qemu" }
network_enabled = { type = "bool", prompt = "Want to enable network?", default = true }
```

### `prompt` property

The `prompt` will be used to display a question / message for this very placeholder on the interactive dialog when using the template.

```plain
ü§∑  What hypervisor to use? [uhyve, qemu] [default: qemu]:
```

### `type` property

A placeholder can be of type `string` or `bool`. Boolean types are usually helpful for conditionally behaviour in templates.

### `choices` property (optional)

A placeholder can come with a list of choices that the user can choose from.
It's further also validated at the time when a user generates a project from a template.

```toml
choices = ["uhyve", "qemu"]
```

### `default` property (optional)

A `default` property must mach the type (`string` | `bool`) and is optional. A default should be provided, to ease the interactive process.
As usual the user could press `enter` and the default value would simply be taken, it safes time and mental load.

```toml
default = 'qemu'
```

### `regex` property (optional)

A `regex` property is a string, that can be used to enforce a certain validation rule. The input dialog will keep repeating
until the user entered something that is allowed by this regex.

### Placeholder Examples

An example with a regex that allows only numbers

```toml
[placeholders]
phone_number = { type = "string", prompt = "What's your phone number?", regex = "^[0-9]+$" }
```

## Default values for placeholders

For automation purposes the user of the template may provide the values for the keys in the template using one or more of the following methods.

The methods are listed by falling priority.

### `--define` or `-d` flag

The user may specify variables individually using the `--define` flag.

```sh
cargo generate template-above -n project-name -d hypervisor=qemu -d network_enabled=true
```

### `--template_values_file` flag

The user of the template may provide a file containing the values for the keys in the template by using the `--template-values-file` flag.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: A relative path will be relative to current working dir, which is *not* inside the expanding template!

The file should be a toml file containing the following (for the example template provided above):

```toml
[values]
hypervisor = "qemu"
network_enabled = true
```

#### Individual values via environment variables

Variables may be specified using environment variables. To do so, set the env var `CARGO_GENERATE_VALUE_<variable key>` to the desired value.

```sh
set CARGO_GENERATE_VALUE_HYPERVISOR=qemu
set CARGO_GENERATE_VALUE_NETWORK_ENABLED=true
cargo generate template-above
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Windows does not support mixed case environment variables. Internally, `cargo-generate` will ensure the variable name is all lowercase. For that reason, it is strongly recommended that template authors only use lowercase variable/placeholder names.

#### Template values file via environment variable

The user may use the environment variable `CARGO_GENERATE_TEMPLATE_VALUES` to specify a file with default values.

For the file format, see above.

#### Default values

Default values may be specified in the config file (specified with the `--config` flag, or in the default config file `$CARGO_HOME/cargo-generate`)

**Example config file:**

```toml
[values]
placeholder1 = "default value"

[favorites.my_favorite]
git = "https://github.com/username-on-github/mytemplate.git"

[favorites.my_favorite.values]
placeholder1 = "default value overriding the default"
placeholder2 = "default value for favorite"
```

## Include / Exclude

Templates support a `cargo-generate.toml`, with a "template" section that allows you to configure the files that will be processed by `cargo-generate`.
The behavior mirrors Cargo's Include / Exclude functionality, which is [documented here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-exclude-and-include-fields-optional).
If you are using placeholders in a file name, and also wish to use placeholders in the contents of that file,
you should setup your globs to match on the pre-rename filename.

```toml
[template]
include = ["Cargo.toml"]
# include and exclude are exclusive, if both appear we will use include
exclude = ["*.c"]
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è NOTE: `exclude` only makes `cargo-generate` ignore any `liquid` tags in the file. In order to exclude a file from being copied to the final dir, see [ignoring files](#Ignoring-files).

The `cargo-generate.toml` file should be placed in the root of the template. If using the `subfolder` feature, the root is the `subfolder` inside the repository, though `cargo-generate` will look for the file in all parent folders until it reaches the repository root.

## Ignoring files

The template author may choose to ignore files completely, by including an `ignore` list in the `cargo-generate.toml` file.

Example:

```toml
[template]
ignore = [ 
  "file",
  "or folder",
  "to be ignored" 
]
```

Both files and folders may be ignored using this method, but currently wildcards are **not supported**.

## Require `cargo-generate` version from template

> Available since version [0.9.0]

Using the supported `cargo-generate.toml` file, the template author may setup version requirements towards `cargo-generate`.

```toml
[template]
cargo_generate_version = ">=0.9.0"
```

The format for the version requirement is [documented here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/specifying-dependencies.html).

## Conditional template settings

Using `cargo-generate.toml`, values and some [`Rhai`] syntax, the template author can make certain conditional decisions before expansion of the template.

`include`, `exclude`, `ignore` and `placeholders` can all be used in sections that are only used based upon the value of one or more values, possibly input by the user using the interactive prompt (if the values in question are defined as placeholders in the non-conditional section).

Using the following example, `cargo-generate` will ask for the `license`, and depending on the `--lib` | `--bin` flags it'll as for the `hypervisor` and `network_enabled` values. It will then continue to expand the template, ignoring the `src/main.rs` file (and thus excluding it from the output) in case `--lib` was specified.

The example is broken up in order to explain each section.

```toml
[template]
cargo_generate_version = ">=0.10.0"
# ignore = [ "..." ]
# include = [ "..." ]
# exclude = [ "..." ]
...
```

This first part declares that the template requires `cargo-generate` version 0.10 or higher. In this same section the template auther may also specify the following 3 lists:

* `ignore` Files/folders on this list will be ignored entirely and are not included in the final output.
* `include` These files will be processed for `Liquid` syntax by the template engine.
* `exclude` These files will *not* be processed for any `liquid` syntax. The files will be in the final output.

```toml
...
[placeholders]
license = { type = "string", prompt = "What license to use?", choices = ["MIT", "Unrestricted"], default = "MIT" }
...
```

This is the section for the *default* placeholders. These are variable definitions that `cargo-generate` knows about and will query for if they are not provided e.g. on the commandline (see [Default-values-for-placeholders]).

The section should contain at least all variables used for any conditions (unless it's an automatic variable such as `crate_type`). All variables that are not specific to a condition are recommended to go here as well.

Here we simply define a variable `license` for selecting the desired license type.

```toml
...
[conditional.'crate_type == "lib"']
ignore = [ "src/main.rs" ]
# include = [ "..." ]
# exclude = [ "..." ]
...
```

This is a conditional block.

Here it has been choosen that the `src/main.rs` file must be ignored when the `crate_type` variable is equal to the string `"lib"`.

```toml
...
[conditional.'crate_type != "lib"'.placeholders]
hypervisor = { type = "string", prompt = "What hypervisor to use?", choices = ["uhyve", "qemu"], default = "qemu" }
network_enabled = { type = "bool", prompt = "Want to enable network?", default = true }
...
```

This block uses the same condition as the last, but it defines some extra placeholders - that is, is defines the variables `hypervisor` and `network_enabled`, so that `cargo-generate` may ask for their values.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `cargo-generate` will ask for values using the placeholders defined in `[placeholders]` before evaluating the conditional sections.
>
> Placeholder values defined in conditional sections **cannot** be used to enable/disable further conditional sections, they can however still be used in the actual template!

```toml
...
[conditional.'license == "MIT"']
ignore = [ "LICENSE-UNRESTRICTED.txt" ]
# include = [ "..." ]
# exclude = [ "..." ]

[conditional.'license == "Unrestricted"']
ignore = [ "LICENSE-MIT.txt" ]
# include = [ "..." ]
# exclude = [ "..." ]
```

This last conditional block is simply to ignore the unneeded license files, based upon the users choice for the `license` variable.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Note that `include` and `exclude` are still mutually exclusive even if they are in different, but included, conditional sections.

## Pre/Post scripts

`cargo-generate` is able to use scripts written in [`Rhai`].

These scripts may be executed as either *pre* or *post*:

1. **pre**: executed before template expansion
2. **post**: executed after template expansion, but before copying to the destination.

> üí¨ TIP for [VSCode] users: A [Rhai language extension] is available for download.

### Use of scripts

In `cargo-generate.toml` write a `[hooks]` section, example:

```toml
[template]
cargo_generate_version = "0.10.0"

[hooks]
pre = ["pre-script.rhai"]
#post = [...]

[placeholders]
license = { type = "string", prompt = "What license to use?", choices = ["APACHE", "MIT"], default = "MIT" }
```

Now, write the script in [`Rhai`], utilizing the `cargo-generate` [provided extensions](#Rhai-extensions):

```rhai
// we can see existing variables.
// note that template and Rhai variables are separate!
let crate_type = variable::get("crate_type")
debug(`crate_type: ${crate_type}`);

let license = variable::get("license").to_upper();
while switch license {
  "APACHE" => {
    file::delete("LICENSE-MIT");
    file::rename("LICENSE-APACHE", "LICENSE");
    false
  }
  "MIT" => {
    file::delete("LICENSE-APACHE");
    file::rename("LICENSE-MIT", "LICENSE");
    false
  }
  _ => true,
} {
  license = variable::prompt("Select license?", "MIT", [
    "APACHE",
    "MIT",
  ]);
}
variable::set("license", license);
```

### Rhai extensions

Besides the basic [`Rhai`] features, these are the modules/behaviors defined:

#### Variables

##### get/set

* **`variable::is_set(name: &str) -> bool`**

  Returns true if the variable/placeholder has been set for the template

* **`variable::get(name: &str) -> value`**

  Gets any defined variable in the `Liquid` template object

* **`variable::set(name: &str, value: (&str|bool))`**

  Set new or overwrite existing variables. Do not allow to change types.

##### Prompt

* **`variable::prompt(text: &str, default_value: bool) -> value`**

  Prompt the user for a boolean value

* **`variable::prompt(text: &str) -> value`**

  Prompt the user for a string value

* **`variable::prompt(text: &str, default_value: &str) -> value`**

  Prompt the user for a string value, with a default already in place

* **`variable::prompt(text: &str, default_value: &str, regex: &str) -> value`**

  Prompt the user for a string value, validated with a regex

* **`variable::prompt(text: &str, default_value: &str, choices: Array) -> value`**

  Prompt the user for a choice value

#### Files

* **`file::rename(from: &str, to: &str)`**

  Rename one of the files in the template folder

* **`file::delete(path: &str)`**

  Delete a file or folder inside the template folder

* **`file::write(file: &str, content: &str)`**

  Create/overwrite a file inside the template folder

* **`file::write(file: &str, content: Array)`*

  Create/overwrite a file inside the template folder, each entry in the array on a new line

#### Other

* **abort(reason: &str)**: Aborts `cargo-generate` with a script error.

## Useful for template authors

> Available since version [0.9.0]

As a template author you're probably concerned about successful builds of your template?

Imagine a couple of months after your first template release, some new versions of any dependencies would break your template, and you would not even be aware of it?

The answer to this question is a vital build pipeline for your template project. This challenge got now much simpler to solve with the new official [GitHub Action cargo-generate][gh/action].

Here an example:

```sh
tree .github
.github
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ workflows
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ build.yml
```

The content of `build.yml` as a paste template:

```yaml
name: Build Template
on:
  # https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#workflow_dispatch
  workflow_dispatch:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 18 * * 5'
  push:
    branches: [ '*' ]
    paths-ignore:
      - "**/docs/**"
      - "**.md"

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    env:
      PROJECT_NAME: mytemplate
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      - uses: cargo-generate/cargo-generate-action@v0.11.0
        with:
          name: ${{ env.PROJECT_NAME }}
      - uses: actions-rs/toolchain@v1
        with:
          toolchain: stable
      # we need to move the generated project to a temp folder, away from the template project
      # otherwise `cargo` runs would fail 
      # see https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/9922
      - run: |
          mv $PROJECT_NAME ${{ runner.temp }}/
          cd ${{ runner.temp }}/$PROJECT_NAME
          cargo check
```

This is a very simple pipeline that builds weekly and on push.
It processes your template repo and runs a `cargo check` as the final step. That's it, a good start to build on.

## Cargo gen - alias

`cargo gen` requires a [cargo alias](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/config.html)
to be configured in your `$HOME/.cargo/config` like this:

```toml
[alias]
gen = "generate"
```
