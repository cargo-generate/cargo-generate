`cargo-generate` is a developer tool to help you get up and running quickly with a new Rust
project by leveraging a pre-existing git repository as a template.

Here's an example of using `cargo-generate` with [this template]:

## Installation

### Using `cargo` with system's OpenSSL

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate
```

See the [`openssl-sys` crate readme] on how to obtain the OpenSSL library for your system. Alternatively, use the `vendored-openssl` flag if you do not want to install OpenSSL.

[`openssl-sys` crate readme]: https://crates.io/crates/openssl-sys

### Using `cargo` with vendored OpenSSL

```sh
cargo install cargo-generate --features vendored-openssl
```

### Manual Install:

1. Download the binary tarball for your platform from our [releases page](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/releases).

2. Unpack the tarball and place the binary `cargo-generate` in `~/.cargo/bin/`

## Usage

Standard usage is to pass a `--git` flag to `cargo generate` or short `cargo gen`. This will prompt you to enter the name of your project.

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/githubusername/mytemplate.git
```

You can also pass the name of your project to the tool using the `--name` or `-n` flag:

```sh
cargo generate --git https://github.com/githubusername/mytemplate.git --name myproject
```

## Favorites

Favorite templates can be defined in a config file, that by default is placed at `$CARGO_HOME/cargo-generate`. 
To specify an alternative configuration file, use the `--config <config-file>` option.

Each favorite template is specified in its own section, e.g.:

```toml
[favorites.demo]
description = "Demo template for cargo-generate"
git = "https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/wasm-pack-template"
branch = "master"
```

Both `branch` and `description` are optional, and the branch may be overridden by specifying `--branch <branch>` on the command line.

When favorites are available, they can be generated simply by invoking:

```cli
cargo gen <favorite>
```

or slightly more involved:

```cli
cargo generate demo --branch master --name expanded_demo
```

> NOTE: when `<favorite>` is not defined in the config file, it is interpreted as a git repo like as if `--git <favorite>`

## Templates

Templates are git repositories whose files contain placeholders. The current
supported placeholders are:

- `{{authors}}`: this will be filled in by a function borrowed from Cargo's source code, that determines your information from Cargo's configuration.
- `{{project-name}}`: this is supplied by either passing the `--name` flag to the command or working with the interactive CLI to supply a name.
- `{{crate_name}}`: the snake_case_version of `project-name`
- `{{os-arch}}`: contains the current operating system and architecture ex: `linux-x86_64`

Additionally all filters and tags of the liquid template language are supported. 
For more information, check out the [Liquid Documentation on `Tags` and `Filters`][liquid].

[liquid]: https://shopify.github.io/liquid

You can also add a `.genignore` file to your template. The files listed in the `.genignore` file
will be removed from the local machine when `cargo-generate` is run on the end user's machine.
The `.genignore` file is always ignored, so there is no need to list it in the `.genignore` file.

Here's a list of [currently available templates](TEMPLATES.md).
If you have a great template that you'd like to feature here, please [file an issue or a PR]!

## Template defined placeholders

Sometimes templates need to make decisions. For example one might want to conditionally include some code or not. 
Another use case might be that the user of a template should be able to choose out of provided options in an interactive way.
Also it might be helpful to offer a reasonable default value that the user just simply can use.

Since version [0.6.0](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/releases/tag/v0.6.0) it is possible to use placeholders in a `cargo-generate.toml` that is in the root folder of a template.  
Here [an example](https://github.com/sassman/hermit-template-rs):

```toml
[placeholders.hypervisor]
type = "string"
prompt = "What hypervisor to use?"
choices = ["uhyve", "qemu"]
default = "qemu"

[placeholders.network_enabled]
type = "bool"
prompt = "Want to enable network?"
default = true
```

As you can see the `placeholders` configuration section accepts a table of keywords that will become the placeholder name.

In this example the placeholder `hypervisor` and `network_enabled` will become template variables and can be used like this:

```rs
{% if network_enabled %}
use std::net::TcpListener;

fn main() {
    let listener = TcpListener::bind("0.0.0.0:8080").unwrap();
    loop {
        let (conn, addr) = listener.accept().unwrap();
        println!("Incoming Connection from {}", addr);
        std::io::copy(&mut &conn, &mut &conn).unwrap();
    }
}
{% else %}
fn main() {
    println!("Hello Rusty Hermit ðŸ¦€");
}
{% endif %}
```

> Note: similar to `dependencies` in the `Cargo.toml` file you can also list them as one liners:
```toml
[placeholders]
hypervisor = { type = "string", prompt = "What hypervisor to use?", choices = ["uhyve", "qemu"], default = "qemu" }
network_enabled = { type = "bool", prompt = "Want to enable network?", default = true }
```

### `prompt` property

The `prompt` will be used to display a question / message for this very placeholder on the interactive dialog when using the template.

```plain
ðŸ¤·  What hypervisor to use? [uhyve, qemu] [default: qemu]:
```

### `type` property

A placeholder can be of type `string` or `bool`. Boolean types are usually helpful for conditionally behaviour in templates.

### `choices` property (optional)

A placeholder can come with a list of choices that the user can choose from. 
It's further also validated at the time when a user generates a project from a template.

```toml
choices = ["uhyve", "qemu"]
```

### `default` property (optional)

A `default` property must mach the type (`string` | `bool`) and is optional. A default should be provided, to ease the interactive process.
As usual the user could press <enter> and the default value would simply be taken, it safes time and mental load.

```toml
default = 'qemu'
```

### `regex` property (optional)

A `regex` property is a string, that can be used to enforce a certain validation rule. The input dialog will keep repeating 
until the user entered something that is allowed by this regex.

### Placeholder Examples

An example with a regex that allows only numbers
```toml
[placeholders]
phone_number = { type = "string", prompt = "What's your phone number?", regex = "[0-9]+" }
```

## Default values for placeholders from a file

For automation purposes the user of the template may provide provide a file containing the values for the keys in the template by using the `--template-values-file` flag.

The file should be a toml file containing the following (for the example template provided above):

```toml
[values]
hypervisor = "qemu"
network_enabled = true
```

## Include / Exclude

Templates support a `cargo-generate.toml`, with a "template" section that allows you to configure the files that will be processed by `cargo-generate`.
The behavior mirrors Cargo's Include / Exclude functionality, which is [documented here](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-exclude-and-include-fields-optional). 
If you are using placeholders in a file name, and also wish to use placeholders in the contents of that file, 
you should setup your globs to match on the pre-rename filename.

```toml
[template]
include = ["Cargo.toml"]
# include and exclude are exclusive, if both appear we will use include
exclude = ["*.c"]
```
