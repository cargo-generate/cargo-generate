`cargo-generate` is a developer tool to help you get up and running quickly with a new Rust
project by leveraging a pre-existing git repository as a template.

Here's an example of using `cargo-generate` with [this template]:

## Installation

```
cargo install cargo-generate
```

`cargo-generate` has a few dependencies that need to be available before it can be installed and used.

* `openssl`: See the [`openssl-sys` crate readme] on how to obtain the openssl library for your system.
* [`git`]: It is used to download the templates.
* `cmake`: Check if it is installed by typing `cmake --version` in a terminal or command line window. If it is not available, check your package
  manager or see the [cmake homepage].

[`git`]: https://git-scm.com/downloads
[cmake homepage]: https://cmake.org/download/

## Usage

Standard usage is to pass a `--git` flag to `cargo generate` or short `cargo gen`. This will prompt you to enter the name of your project.

```
cargo generate --git https://github.com/githubusername/mytemplate.git
```

You can also pass the name of your project to the tool using the `--name` or `-n` flag:

```
cargo generate --git https://github.com/githubusername/mytemplate.git --name myproject
```

## Templates

Templates are git repositories whose files contain placeholders. The current
supported placeholders are:

- `{{authors}}`: this will be filled in by a function borrowed from Cargo's source code, that determines your information from Cargo's configuration.
- `{{project-name}}`: this is supplied by either passing the `--name` flag to the command or working with the interactive CLI to supply a name.
- `{{crate_name}}`: the snake_case_version of `project-name`
- dates: the liquid date filter is enabled for this project. This means you can write something like `{{ "now" | date: "%Y-%m-%d %H:%M" }}`. For more information, check out the [Liquid Documentation on `date`].

[Liquid Documentation on `date`]: https://shopify.github.io/liquid/filters/date/

You can also add a `.genignore` file to your template. The files listed in the `.genignore` file
will be removed from the local machine when `cargo-generate` is run on the end user's machine.
The `.genignore` file is always ignored, so there is no need to list it in the `.genignore` file.

Here's a list of [currently available templates](TEMPLATES.md).
