## [0.6.0] 2021-03-07
- ### ‚ú® Features
    - [interactive variable <enter> leads to default](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/pull/297),
      [issue/17](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/issues/17),
      by [sassman](https://github.com/sassman)

      This allows for lazy typing when using custom variables in templates, so that a user does not need to
      type the default value, but rather can press <enter> in order to accept the default value that is presented.

    - [Add `--vcs none` option to avoid initializing git repo](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/pull/293),
      [issue/244](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/issues/244),
      by [taurr](https://github.com/taurr)

    - [Add favorites on cargo-generate.toml user config file](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/pull/292),
      [issue/210](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/issues/210),
      by [taurr](https://github.com/taurr)

      This allows you to specify one or more shortcuts / favourites in your personal cargo-generate config file under
      `$CARGO_HOME/cargo-generate` or `$HOME/.cargo/cargo-generate`.
      You can read more about [this feature here](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate#favorites)
      
      Update: [on backwards compatibility](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/pull/309) by [sassman](https://github.com/sassman)

    - [Add user specific template variables](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/pull/275),
      [issue/17](https://github.com/cargo-generate/cargo-generate/issues/17),
      by [pedrohjordao](https://github.com/pedrohjordao)

      This allows a template author to define template specific variables. Those variables can be of type string and bool.
      Further more they can be a choice of a provided list.
      You can read more about [this feature here in the docs](https://docs.rs/cargo-generate/0.6.0/cargo_generate/).

      A brief example:
      ```toml
      [placeholders]
      my-placeholder = { type = "string", prompt = "Hello?", choices = ["hello", "world"], default = "hello", regex = "*" }
      use-serde = { type = "bool", prompt = "Add serde support?", default = false }
      ```

    - **Don't remove .github directory when only .git should be removed - [softprops], [issue/190] [pull/191]**

      When generating a new project, cargo-generate will remove the `.git` directory and initialize a new git tree. In
      doing so, it would remove any file or directory containing `.git`, including `.github`. This release fixes that
      bug!

- ### ‚ú® Features

    - **Add config file for configuring include / exclude of files to template - [xortive], [pull/174]**

      Adds support for
      the [cargo-generate.toml](https://github.com/ashleygwilliams/cargo-generate/blob/master/README.md#include--exclude)
      file, which allows templates to configure which files should be processed, either using a whitelist
      method (`include`), or a blacklist method (`exclude`). When both `include` and `exclude` are present, `include`
      will be preferred. This
      mirrors [similar `include`/`exclude` behavior in `cargo`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/manifest.html#the-exclude-and-include-fields-optional)
      , and uses some of the same code.

      #### Include List

        ```toml
        [template]
        include = ["Cargo.toml", "src/lib.rs"] # Only search for and replace template tags in Cargo.toml and src/lib.rs
        ```

      #### Exclude List

        ```toml
        [template]
        exclude = ["public/image.js"] # Don't look for template tags in public/image.js
        ```

      #### Invalid Configuration

        ```toml
        [template]
        # This is an "invalid" configuration, so cargo-generate takes the "more specific" include option
        # and will only search for and replace template tags in Cargo.toml.
        include = ["Cargo.toml"]
        exclude = ["public/image.js"]
        ```

      The `--branch` flag will now work as intended and set the initial HEAD to the specified branch name. For example,

      branch to `gh-pages`.

      When we previously merged the PR in 0.2.0 that leveraged `cargo` to clone the templates, enabling folks to work
      with private repositories- we introduced a `GitConfig::new` function
      (replacing work done previously by `libgit2`). This function works great- but did not support relative paths. We
      didn't catch this because we weren't testing the relative paths usecase!

      With this PR, [DD5HT] has restored the relative path functionality- and added a test to prevent further
      regressions of this function!
