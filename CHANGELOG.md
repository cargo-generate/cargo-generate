# Changelog

## üåü 0.2.2

  - ### ü§ï Fixes

    - **fix relative paths to templates - [DD5HT], [issue/128] [pull/129]**

      When we previously merged the PR in 0.2.0 that leveraged `cargo` to clone the templates,
      enabling folks to work with private repositories- we introduced a `GitConfig::new` function
      (replacing work done previously by `libgit2`). This function works great- but did not support
      relative paths. We didn't catch this because we weren't testing the relative paths usecase!

      With this PR, [DD5HT] has restored the relative path functionality- and added a test to prevent
      further regressions of this function!

## üå† 0.2.1

  - ### ü§ï Fixes

    - **don't error on missing `.genignore` file - [DD5HT], [issue/116] [pull/120]**

      With 0.2.0 we introduced the idea of a `.genignore` file, however, we didn't account
      the situation where one would not be present. Thanks for filing [an issue][issue/116]
      [Diggsey] and thanks for the quick fix [DD5HT]!

    - **enable use on private repositories- [ChristopherMacGown], [pull/119]**

      This PR leveraged `cargo` to enable the ability to pull authenticated repos. As this
      project grows into something we'd like to integrate into `cargo`, this gives us
      greater functionality and also moves us closer to `cargo`'s codebase. Yay!

    - **exclude submodules git metadata - [ChristopherMacGown], [pull/119]**
  
      Two bugs, one PR! Adding a test found that git metadata wasn't being excluded from
      submodules- now it is! Thanks so much!

    - **Binary Releases for Linux, MacOS, and Windows - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/99] [pull/111] [pull/112]**

      Motivated by a desire to more easily distributed the project - we now build binaries
      for our releases. No more waiting for compilation! You can just download and go!

    - **Allow Liquid Templating `date` filter - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/70] [pull/106]**

      By request, we've turned on the `date` filter for our templates. Now you can add
      nicely formatted dates to your projects! For more information, check out the
      [Liquid `date` filter documentation].

    - **Add `.genignore`, ability to ignore files - [DD5HT], [issue/82] [pull/96]**

      You can now add a `.genignore` file to your template. This file will specify the files
      to be "cleaned up" or "removed" from the template once it has been cloned to the user's
      local machine.

    - **Add `--branch` for specifying a branch - [posborne], [issue/71] [pull/94]**

      We originally had no way to specify a git template on a per branch basis, opting to
      only support the primary branch. Now you can specify a branch:

      ```
      cargo generate --git <gitURL> --branch <branchname>
      ```

    - **Warn user if we change project name casing - [k0pernicus], [issue/65] [pull/84]**

      `cargo-generate` will automagically "fix" the casing of your project name to
      match Cargo standards. If we end up changing the name you provide- we'll warn
      to let you know!

## üí• 0.1.1

  - ### ü§ï Fixes

    - **Fix command to work properly as a cargo command - [csmoe], [issue/39] [pull/44]**

      Previous to this commit, `cargo-generate` was a CLI tool that was invoked by the
      command `cargo-generate` (note the dash). However, this tool intends to be a cargo
      subcommand! This commit changes how you invoke the tool- no more dash!

      ```
      cargo generate --git https://github.com/username/project --name look-ma-no-dash
      ```

    - **Fix casing on `crate_name` substitution - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/41] [pull/56]**

      `crate_name` substitution is supposed to be a convenience, converting the given
      project's name to a name that you could use with `extern crate` or in other *in-code*
      situations. Just one problem- before this commit, it didn't change the case! 
      Now it will. Thanks so much to [fitzgen] for filing this issue (and a bunch of others)!

  - ### üìñ Documentation

    - **Document build and runtime dependencies - [migerh], [issue/42] [pull/45]**

      There are a few dependencies for the project that we hadn't documented. Many folks
      have these already installed, but some don't- so it's great that they are now well
      documented in the `README`.

  - ### üõ†Ô∏è Maintenance

    - **Test substitutions - [ashleygwilliams], [issue/34] [pull/56]**

      We had features we weren't testing. This PR now adds test coverage for:

        - substitution of `crate_name`
        - correct casing change of `crate_name`
        - substitution in files beyond `Cargo.toml`

      We still don't have full coverage but at least it's improving!
