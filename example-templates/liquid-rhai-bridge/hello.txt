{% assign my_variable = "Any liquid variable created/assigned in a file" -%}

This is an example of how to use the VERY cool rhai filter feature.
We use a Liquid filter to run a Rhai script:

{{"rhai-example.rhai"|rhai}}

{{liquid_variable_from_rhai}}

Though after liquid itself has used the value, or processing the next file has begun, any changes
to the variable by a rhai filter will be ignored (by liquid) until the next liquid file!

{{ my_variable }} is not carried over to other files, but the ones from Rhai are!
